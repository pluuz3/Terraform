Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter.

AWS DevOps, is an IAC (infrastructure as code) tool similar to AWS CloudFormation that allows you to create, update, and version your Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.

Terraform VS Ansible
- Backed by RedHat Terraform acts like an orchestrator, using Packer for automation. Terraform is more of an infrastructure provisioning tool. Terraform talks to VMWare, AWS, GCP, and deploys infrastructure.

- Ansible by RedHat also is an automation tool that helps drive complexity away and accelerate DevOps initiatives.

- Pro and Con
  1)Ansible is a bit of a hybrid since it can do both, perform orchestration and replace infrastructure. 
  2)Terraform is more widely used. It's considered the superior product since it has advanced state management capabilities, which Ansible does not.
